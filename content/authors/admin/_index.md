<div style="text-align:justify">
I am an Assistant Professor of Information Systems at McGill University. My research broadly seek to understand the impact of digital technology on market, media, politics, and society. I am particularly concerned with bias, inequality, and polarization that may exist in many large-scale socio-technical systems (e.g. Wikipedia, social media, broadcast media, online platforms). I am passionate about working on exposing and understanding such inequities as well as toward learning how we can overcome them to facilitate greater economic and societal outcomes. In my research, I combine machine learning, natural language processing, causal inference, and other computational tools to learn about human behavior and system dynamics in the real-world using large-scale structured and unstructured data.
