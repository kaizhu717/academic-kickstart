My research broadly seeks to understand the impact of technology on our economy, culture, and society. Having training in both economics and computer science, I combine machine learning, natural language processing, and causal inference to learn about human behavior and system dynamics in the real-world. I aim to advance our understanding of these dynamic processes using large-scale empirical and data-oriented research, so that we can better leverage our knowledge to facilitate greater business and societal success.
