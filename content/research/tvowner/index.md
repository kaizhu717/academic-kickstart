# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Broadcast TV in the United States is an information system comprised of hundreds of local television stations that both produce their own information and syndicate information from other sources (such as major networks). In this system, a few media conglomerates are behind the vast amount of information produced and disseminated. There has been an increasing trend of media consolidation in recent years and this raises the very real concern that conglomerate owners have both the means and motive to skew information. When large owners act coherently, they can skew information to emphasize views, perspectives, framing, coverage and attention. This is important because broadcast media has a dramatic impact on political and social outcomes and undeniably shapes the national dialogue surrounding important issues. Unfortunately, we know little about how ownership affects information skew and lack a systematic empirical evaluation of content and ownership at sufficient scale and detail. In this study, we quantify and investigate the consequences of information system ownership, specifically in terms of diversity of information and political polarization, in one of our most important mass information systems - broadcast televised news. We aim to understand how does media ownership impact information diversity, political polarization, and topic coverage in TV news. To examine the impact of ownership, we focus on the natural experiments of hundreds of station acquisitions by new owners over a six year time span. The change of ownership allow us to disentangle the impact of owner of a TV station from other characteristics that may also correlated with the information produced by a station.
