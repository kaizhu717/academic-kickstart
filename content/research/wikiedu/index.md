abstract: Open collaboration platforms have fundamentally changed the way knowledge is produced, disseminated 
and consumed. In these systems, contributions arise organically with little to no central governance. While 
such decentralization provides many benefits, a lack of broad oversight and coordination can leave 
questions of information poverty and skewness to the mercy of the systemâ€™s natural dynamics. 
Unfortunately, we still lack a basic understanding of the dynamics at play in these systems, and specifically, 
how contribution and attention interact and propagate through information networks. We leverage a large
scale natural experiment to study how exogenous content contributions to Wikipedia articles affect the 
attention they attract and how that attention spills over to other articles in the network. Results reveal that 
exogenously added content leads to significant, substantial and long-term increases in both content 
consumption and subsequent contributions. Furthermore, we find significant attention spillover to 
downstream hyperlinked articles. Through both analytical estimation and empirically-informed simulation, 
we evaluate policies to harness this attention contagion to address the problem of information poverty and 
skewness. We find that harnessing attention contagion can lead to as much as a twofold increase in the total 
attention flow to clusters of disadvantaged articles. Our findings have important policy implications for 
open collaboration platforms and information networks.
