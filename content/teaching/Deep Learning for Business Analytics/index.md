*Description*: I help design and develop a new course about Python and Neural Network for business analytics as part of the recently launched Master of Science in Business Analytics program at Questrom School of Business, Boston University. The course teaches student using Python for data science and deep learning as a tool for business analytics. It covers topics such as theory and fundamentals of Neural Network, Convolutional Neural Network, Recurrent Neural Network, and a Capstone project of application of deep learning methods for business data. The course is comprised of 20 sessions and each session is a 3.5 hour long intensive class including both lecture and hands-on exercise and projects.
